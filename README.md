# WEB103 Project 3 - Virtual Community Space

Submitted by: Patrick Matshumba

About this web app: I've developed an interactive virtual community platform where users can browse and discover events based on their location.

Time spent: 25 hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

<!-- Make sure to check off completed functionality below -->

- [x] **The web app uses React to display data from the API**
- [x] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured Events table**
- [x] **NOTE: Your GIF or a screenshot added to this README must include a view of your Railway database that shows the contents of the table used by your app**
- [x] **The web app displays the title of the app**
- [x] **A visual interface allows the user to select a Location they would like to view**
- [x] **Clicking on a Location shows a list of all items from the Events table that corresponds to that Location**
- [x] **Each Location detail page should have its own unique URL**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] An additional page shows all possible `Events` that the user can sort and filter by `Location`
- [ ] `Events` display a countdown showing the time remaining before that event and appears with different formatting when the event has passed

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

I'm currently struggling to follow the file structure in Vite. It's been challenging to understand the best practices for organizing files and folders effectively within the Vite framework. Further clarification or resources on optimal file organization would be beneficial.
